### Notes:

A CLI-based application made with the Go language. This application allows users to book tickets from a predefined dataset. User details such as name, email, and the number of requested tickets are captured via the CLI.

The application is created with the Go language and uses the following features/dependencies:

- `fmt` (for capturing and rendering I/O operations)
- `sync` (`WaitGroup` – to wait for concurrent threads to finish)
- `time` (`Sleep` – to add fake processing delay)
- Packages (project-level packages)
- Structs (to create custom data type structures)
- For loops
- Arrays
- Variable scopes – Local, Project, Global
